Reassembling the fragments yields five-word sets.  In each case you
overlap a two-word fragment with the top half of a three-word
fragment, a two-word fragment with the bottom half of a three-word
fragment, and then connect the two fragments.

In each column, exactly two of the words in each set have a common
letter.  Taking these letters gives a new set of 19 words:
</p>

<pre>ANTIS
DIANA
EDEMA
ELMER
ERASE
FAITH
GETTY
HOFFA
ISSEL
LEAVE
MAORI
NAMED
OESTE
RANDI
RIFLE
SERGE
TETRA
THROE
VEGAN
</pre>

<p>
These words can make a chain (overlapping the first two letters and
the last two letters) like so:
</p>

<pre>HOFFA
   FAITH
      THROE
         OESTE
            TETRA
               RANDI

                           MAORI
                              RIFLE
                                 LEAVE
                                    VEGAN
                                       ANTIS
                                          ISSEL
                                             ELMER
                                                ERASE
                                                   SERGE
                                                      GETTY

<p>
and the letters that aren&rsquo;t overlapped (the middle letters)
spell FIRST NAME OF AGT SMART, which gives the answer <b>MAXWELL</b>.
