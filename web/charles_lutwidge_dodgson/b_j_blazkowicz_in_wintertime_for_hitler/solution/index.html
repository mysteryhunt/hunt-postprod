<p>The .zip file attached to the puzzle contained a complete
playable&mdash;but slightly altered&mdash;shareware version of the classic id
Software game <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D">Wolfenstein
3D</a>.  It&rsquo;s been rethemed to give it a &ldquo;Producers&rdquo; feel.
You can play the game on an original IBM PC, if you happen to have one
around, or using &ldquo;<a href="http://www.dosbox.com">DOSBox</a>&rdquo;
or &ldquo;<a href="http://www.dosemu.org">dosemu</a>&rdquo; on a modern operating system.
You can also use the <a href="http://www.alice-dsl.net/mkroll/downloads.html">Wolf4SDL</a>
port to run these files.
</p>

<p>There are ten saved game files included in the ZIP.  Each one
has a funny Producers-related name, and starts you off on a different
level of the game, 1-10 in order.  (The &ldquo;secret level&rdquo; is level 10.)
For mercy&rsquo;s sake, you&rsquo;re on &ldquo;Bring &rsquo;em on&rdquo; difficulty, not &ldquo;I am
Death Incarnate!&rdquo;
The saved game file has been hacked to contain slightly different
content from the usual level.  Your starting position is almost the
same as the usual starting position for the level, but you are turned
to face a wall.  On that wall is a poster of some kind.  There is
exactly one other wall matching this one on the level&mdash;and it marks
one of the secret rooms in the game.  Pushing on the poster will open
the room, and in the room is a specific number of treasures.
(To reduce potential red herrings, all treasures in the game have been
changed to crosses.)</p>

<p>Note that these modifications are made <b>only in the saved
game</b>.  If you look for the poster by the starting position
in a normal game, you won&rsquo;t see find it there, which should clue
you in.  So you can&rsquo;t go back and select &ldquo;Can I play, Daddy?&rdquo;
difficulty, you need to play the level on the difficulty level
it was saved at.  On the other hand, I recommend figuring out
how to turn on &ldquo;God Mode,&rdquo; which really does make the whole thing
a lot easier (and more fun).</p>

<p>The name of the saved game file, location of each secret door, and
the number of crosses found in the secret room so marked are as
follows: (Note that these maps are of the unmodified game; they show
enemies not present in &ldquo;Bring &rsquo;em on&rdquo; difficulty level and
the original, not modified, number of treasures in each secret room.)

<p>Indexing into the name of the saved game file by the number of
treasures found in the room gives the phrase, &ldquo;PG38WORD26&rdquo;.  On the
main menu of Wolfenstein is a promenient &ldquo;Read This!&rdquo; entry.  Each
&ldquo;page&rdquo; in this readme is marked; the 38th such page looks like
this:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="pg38.png" /></p>

<p>The 26th word on this page is the last name of John Carmack,
co-founder of id Software and lead programmer for this game.
Thus the answer to this puzzle is <b>CARMACK</b>.</p>

Hasselhoff&rdquo;, &ldquo;Nazis With Attitude&rdquo;, &ldquo;Hitler&rsquo;s Ark&rdquo;, &ldquo;Nazi PANIC!&rdquo;)
were a source of inspiration (and some wall textures), and
