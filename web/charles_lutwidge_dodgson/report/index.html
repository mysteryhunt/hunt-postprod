<p>Originally from England, this theatre critic and games columnist writes under
the pen name Charles Dodgson. His reviews frequently opine that Broadway simply
doesn't live up to West End theatre. When asked about American games, he
replied, "Pure rubbish! You should see the games we played in Oxford. Why,
sometimes I've played as many as six impossible games before breakfast. Here,
let me show you."</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Charles has challenged you to a game of Scrabble Solitaire!  Make
    only the highest-scoring play possible with your rack.  You agree
    with him on a likely-looking book to check your words.</i></p>

<p><i>Draw tiles as follows: First, alphabetize the answers. Then take all the
    first letters in order from top to bottom, then all the second letters, etc.
    Consulting the table below, for each letter pick a legal move from the row,
    play it, and draw the tile in parentheses. Continue until you exhaust the
    letters in your answers.</i></p>

<p><i>Your cumulative scores after each play will be 32, 130, 146, 171, 187, 254,
    328, 342, 357, 387, 402, 426, 455, 481, 520, 621, 641, 653, and 657.</i></p>
