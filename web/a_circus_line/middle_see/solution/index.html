The clues yield:
</p>

BAYER, STAT<br />
LOOT, GAS<br />
CHER, APT<br />
COD, DEER<br />
<br />
BORE, JAMES<br />
DEION, DUCT<br />
SIDE, RENTS<br />

<p>
In every pair, one word can go inside the other to make another word.
</p>

BAY(STAT)ER<br />
GA(LOOT)S<br />
CH(APT)ER<br />
DE(COD)ER<br />
<br />
JAM(BORE)ES<br />
DE(DUCT)ION<br />
RE(SIDE)NTS<br />

<p>
Taking the middle letter of each word (hinted by the title) give TOPO (as in Gigio, the puppet from &ldquo;The Ed Sullivan Show&rdquo;) and OCD. Placing one into the other gives the final answer: <b>OCTOPOD</b>. This step also completes the symmetry, since the insertions have been 3(4)2, 2(4)1, 2(3)2, 2(3)2, 3(4)2, 2(4)3, and 2(4)3; the only one without a partner is 2(4)1 which fits the form of OC(TOPO)D.
