Each figure was played by an actor on at least one episode of Dr. Who, and the caption describes the companions accompanying the Doctor on one of those episodes. Each clue is also as long in words as the episode title is in letters, with each line representing one word, and contains a single instance of the word &ldquo;who&rdquo;. Take the letter at that index and arrange by episode order.
