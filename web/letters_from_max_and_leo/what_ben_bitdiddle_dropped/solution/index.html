<p>This is a scavenger hunt of places in building 7.</p>

<p>Each hint clues a number which is found on a separate floor of
building 7, from the top (4th floor) to the basement.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Number of horse heads plus the number of beards.<br />
  <i>There are 18 horse heads and 6 bearded figures in a mural on the
  fourth floor = 24</i><br />
  <img src="1.jpg" />

  </li><li>What goes <a href="../1.jpg">here</a>.<br />
  <i>The Charles J Connick Stained Glass Foundation Collection on the
  3rd floor, in 7-304 = -</i><br />
  <img src="2.jpg" />
  
  </li><li>What&rsquo;s <a href="../2.jpg">missing</a>.<br />
  <i>A fire extinguisher on the second floor = 3.</i><br />
  <img src="3.jpg" />

  </li><li>Digit following &ldquo;Gift of the L. I. S.&rdquo;.<br />
  <i>The entrance to the infinite corridor contains a plaque
  acknowledging it as a &ldquo;Gift of the Lowell Institute School 1943&rdquo; = 1</i><br />
  <img src="4.jpg" />
  
  </li><li>Maximum flow 600 GPM 7.2_ H20 of <a href="../3.jpg">this</a>.<br />
  <i>In the basement of building 7 is a tag on a valve which states
  the maximum flow rate is &ldquo;7.26 H2O&rdquo; = 7</i><br />
  <img src="5.jpg" />
</li></ol>

<p>These 5 numbers together are: 24-317, which is a room number at
MIT. Teams could go there, and they would find an empty room.</p>

<p>What teams really need to do is enter 24-317 into Ben&rsquo;s device:</p>

<p>
(We decided at the last minute to scattering some components from
<a href="../../../ben_bitdiddle/investigators_report/">Ben Bitdiddle's
investigator report</a> under one of the desks in 24-317, to prevent teams
on the endgame from getting stuck here.
But Manic Sages took those components with them, so we ended up
writing a hint on the blackboard for the rest of the teams which
reached endgame.  In at least one case, this ended up being less
help than hindrance: the team entered into Ben's device every possible
permutation of the hint written on the blackboard before finally
deciding to just enter the room number...)
</p>

<p>When you enter 24-317 into the device, it gives you the location of
the coin: <b>TONY UNDER KRESGE POINT</b>.</p>

<p>If you ended the hunt between 1am and 7am (during which time Kresge
is locked), this would be the end of your hunt.</p>

<p><i>However</i>, if you made it here before 1am or after 7am (as
Manic Sages did), you found <i>another</i> Bitdiddle device, hardwired
to blink out one message: <code>IN KRESGE LITTLE CIRC 13
UP.</code></p>

<p>You would then enter Kresge Little Theater, and start
searching.</p>

<p>Lighting circuit 13 is on the back wall of the theater, behind
a black curtain and a cyc.  Above it is an electrical box, and on top
of that (8 feet or so above the floor) is a box labelled, "Jesus
Christ Super Star Wars" containing a Tony award.</p>

<p>The organizers of the Tonys then materialized from the wings, with
champagne.  Somewhat disturbed at finding you with your Tony early,
they decide to ignore this slight irregularity, considering that Max
and Leo had actually won the Tony for Best Musical.</p>
