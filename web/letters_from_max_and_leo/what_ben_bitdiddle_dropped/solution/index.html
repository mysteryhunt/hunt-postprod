The team has attempted to bribe the six critics for a good review
and then they&rsquo;ve staged their
performance of &ldquo;Jesus Chris Super Star Wars.&rdquo;
Unfortunately, the critics hate the show.  As they file out in disgust,
Ben Bitdiddle pulls the team aside and says, &ldquo;Sorry guys,
but this play&rsquo;s a stinker.  But I&rsquo;m the sysadmin for
the Tonys, and so I&rsquo;ve got some pull there.  I&rsquo;ll see
if I can do something for you; get you a nomination or something.
Terrible plays get nominated all the time!  At least I can try
very hard <i>not to drop something as I leave the room</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He then drops this note as he leaves.</p>

<p>This is a scavenger hunt of places in building 7.</p>

<p>Each hint clues a number which is found on a separate floor of
building 7, from the top (4th floor) to the basement.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Number of horse heads plus the number of beards.<br />
  <i>There are 18 horse heads and 6 bearded figures in a mural on the
  fourth floor = 24</i><br />

  </li><li>What goes <a href="../1.jpg">here</a>.<br />
  <i>The Charles J Connick Stained Glass Foundation Collection on the
  3rd floor, in 7-304 = -</i><br />
  <img src="2.jpg" />
  
  </li><li>What&rsquo;s <a href="../2.jpg">missing</a>.<br />
  <i>A fire extinguisher on the second floor = 3.</i><br />
  <img src="3.jpg" />

  </li><li>Digit following &ldquo;Gift of the L. I. S.&rdquo;.<br />
  <i>The entrance to the infinite corridor contains a plaque
  acknowledging it as a &ldquo;Gift of the Lowell Institute School 1943&rdquo; = 1</i><br />
  <img src="4.jpg" />
  
  </li><li>Maximum flow 600 GPM 7.2_ H20 of <a href="../3.jpg">this</a>.<br />
  <i>In the basement of building 7 is a tag on a valve which states
  the maximum flow rate is &ldquo;7.26 H2O&rdquo; = 7</i><br />
  <img src="5.jpg" />
</li></ol>

<p>These 5 numbers together are: 24-317, which is a room number at
MIT. Teams could go there, and they would find an empty room.</p>

<p>This sheet is really Ben's password reminder, and 
what teams need to do is enter 24-317 into the device
from <a href="../../../ben_bitdiddle/investigators_report/">Ben Bitdiddle's
investigator report</a>:</p>

<p><img src="8.jpg" /></p>

<p>
(We decided at the last minute to scatter some components from Ben's
device under one of the desks in 24-317 as a hint,
to prevent teams on the endgame from getting stuck here.
But Manic Sages took those components with them, so for later teams we
wrote a hint on the blackboard.  In at least one case, the hint on the
blackboard ended up being more hindrance than help:
the team entered into Ben's device every possible
permutation of the hint written on the blackboard before finally
trying just the room number...)
</p>

<p>When you enter 24-317 into the device, it gives you the location of
the coin: <b>TONY UNDER KRESGE POINT</b>.</p>

<p>If you ended the hunt between 1am and 7am (during which time Kresge
is locked), this would be the end of your hunt.</p>

<p><i>However</i>, if you made it here before 1am or after 7am (as
Manic Sages did), you found <i>another</i> Bitdiddle device, hardwired
to blink out one message: <code>IN KRESGE LITTLE CIRC 13
UP.</code></p>

<p>You would then enter Kresge Little Theater, and start
searching.</p>

<p>Lighting circuit 13 is on the back wall of the theater, behind
a black curtain and a cyc.  Above it is an electrical box, and on top
of that (8 feet or so above the floor) is a box labelled, &ldquo;Jesus
Christ Super Star Wars&rdquo; containing a Tony award.</p>

<p><a href="location.jpg"><img src="location-sm.jpg" /></a><br/>
<i>The coin was atop this electrical box</i></p>

<p>The organizers of the Tonys then materialized from the wings, with
champagne.  Although somewhat disturbed to find you with the Tony
early (&ldquo;It's supposed to be a surprise!&rdquo;),
they decide to ignore this slight irregularity, since the Tony award
for Best Musical was indeed Max and Leo&rsquo;s this year!</p>

<p><i>Author note: Our lead editor, Andrew Lin, asked for a final
runaround that went 
through Lobby 7, so that Codex could have a chance to cheer the
winning team on en masse.  I wanted to try to write a runaround that wouldn't
stretch a large team out unmanageably, because in my past experience
it&rsquo;s disappointing when not everyone can be near the front when some important
thing is found.  So I ended up with a &ldquo;runaround&rdquo;
completely contained within a single building, with a large central
open space to make it easier to keep tabs on your team.  The optimal solution
strategy for this also somewhat deliberately echoed the strategy
Codex (unnecessarily) employed to win the 2011 hunt&mdash;split up
and brute force search all floors.</i></p>

<p><i>And after creating such a nice Ben Bitdiddle device, I couldn't
resist using it a couple more times in the end game.  Perhaps this was
a subtle way to ensure that whomever was my equivalent on the winning
team got their moment of glory as they read out the final clue in
Morse...</i></p>

<p><i>Many thanks to Andrew and Emily for indulging me on this part of
the hunt.</i></p>
