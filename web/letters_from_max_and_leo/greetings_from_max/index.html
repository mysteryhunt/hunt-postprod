<p>
It&rsquo;s so simple. We had the right idea with Springtime for Hitler, we just didn&rsquo;t think big enough. This time, instead of making one terrible musical, we&rsquo;re going to make lots of terrible musicals!
</p>
<p>
Since you&rsquo;re helping us put on these shows, part of the profit will be yours. You&rsquo;ll be a producer too! You just need to be brave enough to reach out and grab it. Dare to dream big&mdash;drink champagne, not ginger ale!
</p>
<p>
Now if Leo and I tried the same tricks again, the police would catch on right away. That&rsquo;s why this time we changed our names&mdash;nobody will see it coming! So don&rsquo;t call me Bialystock, I&rsquo;m Max Borbonicus from now on. Bialystock&rsquo;s gone, Borbonicus is a name you can trust. The same with Leo&mdash;He&rsquo;s Leo Bodley now, not Bloom.

<p>
The time has come to make the magic of theater happen, but poorly. Think about what would make a good show, and do the opposite.
</p>
<p>
This letter isn&rsquo;t important, it&rsquo;s making the shows that is. Go to it!
</p>
<p>
Remember: we can do it, and GOOD LUCK!
