<p class="p1"><span class="part">Leo:</span> Oh, god, I just had the most horrible nightmare. I dreamed Max and I were producing another musical -- this time at MIT for some reason. It was like we&#8217;d learned nothing from &#8220;Springtime for Hitler&#8221;!</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="part">Max</span> <span class="stagedir">(entering)</span>: We haven&#8217;t!</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="part">Leo:</span> Max! No! Leave me alone!</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="part">Max:</span> Leo, my boy. My friend. Bubbeleh. How long has it been? How long has it been since we&#8217;ve seen our names in lights?</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="part">Leo:</span> Not long enough.</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="part">Max:</span> Well, that&#8217;s all going to change right now! I&#8217;ve had a brilliant idea! Do you remember when we produced &#8220;Springtime for Hitler&#8221;?</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="part">Leo:</span> Vividly. Especially the part where we went to jail.</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="part">Max:</span> Well, I&#8217;ve figured out what we did wrong.</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="part">Leo:</span> ...Break the law?</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="part">Max:</span> No! We didn&#8217;t think...BIG enough!</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="part">Leo:</span> Oh god.</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="part">Max:</span> My new plan is simplicity itself. We&#8217;re going to produce not one Broadway flop, not two, not three, not four, but MORE THAN THAT!</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="part">Leo:</span> Oh GOD. How long will this go on?</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="part">Max:</span> Until I run out of ideas.</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="part">Leo:</span> How long will that be?</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="part">Max:</span> Not long.</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="part">Leo:</span> Max, we can&#8217;t do this. It&#8217;s madness.</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="part">Max:</span> But Leo! I&#8217;m trying to tell you. I&#8217;ve learned my lesson this time.</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="part">Leo:</span> I&#8217;m really not sure you have.</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="part">Max:</span> I have! Last time, we went to Broadway too soon! That was reckless! This time, we&#8217;re going to hire script doctors, here, at MIT, to work on the shows and make sure they&#8217;re as terrible as possible.</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="part">Leo:</span> Well...okay...I guess that makes sense.</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="part">Max:</span> Of course it makes sense! These are some of the smartest people in the country! In the world! In ... what&#8217;s the next thing after that?</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1 stagedir">(voice in crowd: The universe!)</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="part">Max:</span> See? They&#8217;re geniuses!</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="part">Leo:</span> And you think they&#8217;d be willing to help us?</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="part">Max:</span> Sure they will. We&#8217;ll cut them in on the profits, send them a nice card from the tropical island we&#8217;re going to buy&mdash;what do you say, everyone, will you help us?</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1 stagedir">(Everyone agrees, as cued by the teleprompter they are reading right now)</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1 stagedir">(Then they quiet down so we can continue the scene)</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="part">Leo:</span> Okay! It&#8217;s against my better judgment, but I&#8217;m convinced! Bialystock and Bloom are back in business!</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="part">Max:</span> NOOOOOOO!!!</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="part">Leo:</span> What? I thought you said we were going to&mdash;</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="part">Max:</span> Yes. We are. But Bialystock and Bloom are criminals. No one would invest money in a show by Bialystock and Bloom.</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="part">Leo:</span> I&#8217;m so confused.</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="part">Max:</span> I&#8217;ve taken the liberty of changing our names. Goodbye, Bialystock and Bloom&mdash;hello, Borbonicus and Bodley!</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="part">Leo:</span> Which one am I?</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="part">Max:</span> The second one. You&#8217;re always the second one.</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="part">Leo:</span> All right. So let me see if I have this straight. We&#8217;re going to produce a whole lot of musicals.</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="part">Max:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="part">Leo:</span> With the help of all these people.</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="part">Max:</span> God, I love hearing my plans repeated back to me. Go on.</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="part">Leo:</span> And they&#8217;re going to work on the show to make them worse...</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="part">Max:</span> Doing lots of research!</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="part">Leo:</span> Research?</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="part">Max:</span> You know, dramaturgy.</p>

<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="part">Max</span> <span class="stagedir">(waving hands)</span>: Puzzles.</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="part">Leo:</span> Okay. Sure. And then the shows will bomb, we&#8217;ll keep all the investors&#8217; money, make a bundle and we&#8217;ll give them...</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="part">Max:</span> I don&#8217;t know, some percentage to be determined. An honorarium of some sort.</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="part">Leo:</span> I hope you&#8217;re not planning to cheat these people. I&#8217;m pretty sure they can do math.</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="part">Max:</span> No. It will be a very valuable ... thing in the form of something very much like money.</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="part">Leo:</span> Well, that&#8217;s a relief. You know what, Max? I&#8217;m excited! This could work, this could actually work this time!</p>
