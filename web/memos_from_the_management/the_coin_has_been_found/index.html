title: The Coin Has Been Found

<p>
At XX:XXpm on Saturday, January 14, 2012,
Max and Leo were discovered on the stage of Kresge Little Theater while in
the company of Manic Sages.
They appeared to be in the process of stealing the Tony award;
however, the organizers of the Tony decided to look the other
way, considering that Max and Leo's play Jesus Christ Super Star Wars
was actually the legitimate winner of this year's Tony for
Best Musical.
</p>

<p>We invite you all to the Tony award ceremony,
which will be held in

at 5pm Sunday, January 15.
</p>

<p>
Hunt headquarters will remain open until 3pm Sunday.
We encourage teams to continue solving puzzles for as long as they are
having fun.  See you at the Tonys!
