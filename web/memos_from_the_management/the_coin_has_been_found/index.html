At XX:XX on XXXXXX, January XX, 2012,
Max and Leo were arrested XXXXWHEREXXX while in
the company of XXXXXTEAMXXXXX.
They appeared to have just stolen the Tony award
of their own hit play XXXXPLAYNAMEXXXX.
</p>

<p>We hope to get them bailed out
in time for the Tony award ceremony,
which will be held in
<a href="">26-100</a>
at 5pm Sunday, January 15.
All are invited.

<p>
Hunt headquarters will remain open until 3pm Sunday.
We encourage teams to continue solving puzzles for as long as they are
enjoying doing so.  See you at the Tonys!
