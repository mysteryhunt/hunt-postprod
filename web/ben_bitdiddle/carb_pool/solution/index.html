Solvers get two bags of pasta, both cut into lengths. The first bag contains:
</p>
6&rdquo; of Bucatini<br />
2&rdquo; of Fettuccine<br />
1&rdquo; of Fusilli<br />
3&rdquo; of Lasagne<br />
4&rdquo; of Spaghetti<br />
5&rdquo; of Udon<br />

<p>
The second bag contains some other lengths, but before we give them the bag we smash the pasta to pieces before their eyes.
</p>
<p>
Reconstructing the broken pieces reveals
</p>
7&rdquo; of Bucatini<br />
10&rdquo; of Fettuccine<br />
3&rdquo; of Fusilli<br />
4&rdquo; of Lasagne<br />
1&rdquo; of Spaghetti<br />
3&rdquo; of Udon<br />

<p>
Sorting by the unique lengths in the first bag and taking the nth letter of the pasta in the second bag (where n is the reconstructed length) gives the final answer: <b>SEASON</b>.
