<p>
A crazed Norwegian obsessed with his quarry<br />
Shoots an innocent who doesn&rsquo;t understand <br />
To fear this alien possessed hound.<br />
</p>
<p>
Soon those at Outpost Thirty One uncover the story<br />
Of an ancient secret buried in this frozen land.<br />
It will infect them, so a blood test is found.<br />
</p>
<p>
They take deep breaths to renew life&rsquo;s <span class="blank">___</span><br />
And fight with explosives, blades and fire.<br />
But many die: this enemy can clearly think.<br />
</p>
<p>
It transforms and kills with apparent <span class="blank">___</span><br />
Until only two remain in a nervous ceasefire.<br />
Exhausted, they simply wait and drink.<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>
A discovery to change mankind,<br />
In an instant, from here to there.<br />
Is this the work of mad science or a brilliant mind,<br />
Inspired by paranoia or a romantic affair?<br />
</p>
<p>
This technology is an unnatural fusion.<br />
There are monstrous consequences to behold.<br />
There is no undoing this biological union.<br />
Once released, it cannot be controlled.<br />
</p>
<p>
And it will mutate before the tale is <span class="blank">___</span>.<br />
Heed this warning and take <span class="blank">___</span>.<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>
A quaint seaside town should not be where rogues reside.<br />
But it takes a talented crook to recognize a skilled con man.<br />
When two meet, naturally they will vie for riches and pride.<br />
A wager then, to see who can swindle a mark with the better plan.<br />
Perhaps as a cripple or a doctor, roles played with great <span class="blank">___</span>.<br />
But if they are unaware of a third rival, the Jackal will strike,<br />
Catch them pants down, and bury their pride in a seaside <span class="blank">___</span>.<br />
Let this be a warning to swindlers, thieves and tricksters alike!<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Going on a train ride<br />
Through the Bavarian land.<br />
Foreigners ride alongside,<br />
The vistas were grand.<br />
When the train is stalled<br />
Passengers at an inn are installed.<br />
</p>
<p>
An American gent climbs aboard,<br />
He takes photos and is smart.<br />
Also a governess watching her ward.<br />
And a young woman who captured the gent&rsquo;s heart.<br />
She almost delayed our departure instead,<br />
When drunkenly she fell on her head.<br />
</p>
<p>
Now we&rsquo;ve resumed our journey.<br />
The photog looks smart in his tie and <span class="blank">___</span>.<br />
Yet another passenger needs a gurney.<br />
It would be better to have a <span class="blank">___</span>,<br />
To tend to this sick one,<br />
One of God&rsquo;s Marines, not a nun.<br />
</p>
<p>
The governess goes missing,<br />
Hopefully she&rsquo;ll be found.<br />
She bears a message most pressing<br />
And must be London bound.<br />
You see, the governess role was fake,<br />
And the fate of Europe is at stake!<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>
I admit, I was in a bad situation,<br />
Needing a fix and sentenced to die.<br />
So I accepted the offer to serve my nation,<br />
Train as a killer and tell my old life goodbye.<br />
</p>
<p>
I became an assassin and lady of class.<br />
Killing a VIP at dinner was my final test.<br />
After the hit I escaped by chute, earning a pass.<br />
But a few more targets and I had a request.<br />
</p>
<p>
Because when push comes to <span class="blank">___</span><br />
I would rather not be a government gun.<br />
I&rsquo;d rather have a treasure <span class="blank">___</span><br />
Even if it meant living on the run.<br />
</p>
<p>
I do one last important job so I can get out.<br />
But the agency sends a cleaner to put me away.<br />
He underestimated me, there&rsquo;s no doubt.<br />
I walked into the mist, to live another day.<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>
I have this girl, you see,<br />
Though I don&rsquo;t know what she sees in me.<br />
My life&rsquo;s fraught with danger<br />
Playing this undercover stranger.<br />
</p>
<p>
And a lot of hard life lessons I&rsquo;ve been <span class="blank">___</span>.<br />
I order a Sam Adams on <span class="blank">___</span>.<br />
And I sit and think of her as I drink:<br />
I did my time, and as my shrink,<br />
</p>
<p>
She&rsquo;s supposed to be screwing my head on right<br />
But really we just end up screwing all night.<br />
I&rsquo;m glad she doesn&rsquo;t have a cat in fact;<br />
I hate it when animals catch me in the act.<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Lo, I wave my staff, and watch the tumult writhe<br />
Before me parting like grasses encountering the harvester&rsquo;s scythe.<br />
With excitement for the capture, my pursuers are driven mad with blood lust,<br />
We seek a new land as our home, so we may leave behind the wretched dust.<br />
</p>
<p>
Knowing that while there will be no more goose liver <span class="blank">___</span>,<br />
But rather manna to sustain us, these two things do not <span class="blank">___</span>.<br />
Then the way is made open so we cross, and like a crocodile&rsquo;s maw<br />
Our path snaps shut behind us to crush them, and I shall yet bring the law.<br />
</p>
<p>
And yet the chosen ones celebrate and dance in the dust,<br />
Forsaking their faith more with each vulgar thrust.<br />
I return to them bearing carved words from the divine.<br />
But their actions make them unworthy, as His name they malign.<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Many victims have a dark curse,<br />
Will it claim this foreign blond nurse?<br />
Started from a vicious killing<br />
Yielding ghosts upset and chilling.<br />
Skip past their house in the Far <span class="blank">___</span><br />
Lest you find bodies lain <span class="blank">___</span>.<br />
In the attic they&rsquo;re not long kept,<br />
Gruesome tidings she must accept.<br />
</p>
<p>
Fear the boy of silent staring,<br />
Soon his mother comes a-scaring.<br />
Victim tries to burn their dwelling,<br />
Distracted dies loudly yelling.<br />
Bitter grievance unforgiven,<br />
Female spirit madly driven.<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>
My youthful love, my white virgin on the Nile,<br />
Your return home brings me a great smile.<br />
Where I cannot offer you fame nor splendor<br />
I can be your secrets&rsquo; defender.<br />
</p>
<p>
But you must understand that when you left<br />
I was alone, my heart bereft.<br />
Your sister fell in love with me,<br />
Now you would bring the paparazzi.<br />
</p>
<p>
Asking me to care for your three children,<br />
When I&rsquo;ll soon have five of my own little men!<br />
Still, I acquiesce without missing a <span class="blank">___</span>,<br />
This labor may drown me in my own <span class="blank">___</span>.<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Our numbers daily dwindle.<br />
We do not have enough men.<br />
The few left are green as a pitted <span class="blank">___</span>.<br />
</p>
<p>
The 59th flies to challenge that fearful symbol<br />
The Red Baron; I do not want deaths on my head again.<br />
I fear none may come back <span class="blank">___</span>.<br />
</p>
<p>
We will fly just as the sun<br />
Inspires the rooster&rsquo;s cry.<br />
We&rsquo;ll attack with a bombing run,<br />
And claim the sky.<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Streets and alleys quickly darken,<br />
Thieves and scoundrels the night does harken,<br />
For another so does slither through same inky black,<br />
Though not one of their own pack.<br />
</p>
<p>
He takes wee children from their kin,<br />
To commit his putrid sin;<br />
This the thieves cannot let pass,<br />
For he draws the law men en masse,<br />
</p>
<p>
The police find new clues to forensically <span class="blank">___</span><br />
And thereby deduce his daily <span class="blank">___</span>,<br />
While the beggars listen for his whistled tune:<br />
He is recognized by a blind man selling a balloon.<br />
</p>
<p>
They manage to capture him alone,<br />
And throw him before the head thief&rsquo;s throne,<br />
Harshly they wish to judge, <br />
Yet who should we most begrudge,<br />
</p>
<p>
The man whose hunt is compulsion driven,<br />
Or those who seek wealth&rsquo;s provision?<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Traveling abroad for business was never so daunting.<br />
But a storm, a car crash, and a murder suggest a haunting.<br />
I took shelter from the storm in a home with an ark.<br />
In the middle of a swamp, they wouldn&rsquo;t let me leave in the dark.<br />
</p>
<p>
I&rsquo;m not a clever man, I kept putting my foot in my <span class="blank">___</span>.<br />
But with awful manners, this weird family was quite <span class="blank">___</span>.<br />
In the night a new death, as the clock struck every hour,<br />
And the raging storm threatened to take out the power.<br />
</p>
<p>
Tensions were rising, and headed toward an explosion.<br />
I had to uncover the truth amidst all the confusion.<br />
The killer confessed and then fled out the door.<br />
She died in a blast, to be heard from no more.<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>
We&rsquo;ve wandered the American Southwest<br />
For what seems like a <span class="blank">___</span>.<br />
With nary a moment of rest,<br />
The heat of the sun is too much to <span class="blank">___</span>.<br />
</p>
<p>
My pathetic husband and I<br />
Are really at wits end.<br />
When what do we spy<br />
But a scruffy brigand.<br />
</p>
<p>
This new man will be my fun,<br />
A relief from the road so cruel.<br />
What better to stop boredom<br />
Than an old fashioned duel?<br />
</p>
<p>
I&rsquo;m conniving, I&rsquo;m sneaky,<br />
And I put on a good show.<br />
What will the end be?<br />
Only we three will know.<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>
When attempting a heist never done before,<br />
It&rsquo;s nice to work with a proper villainous team.<br />
The job will take more than ten men to score,<br />
Running multiple cons woven in a complex scheme.<br />
</p>
<p>
Two with a plan and a financier to get things started.<br />
A dealer and a pickpocket to lift a card,<br />
With others to make sure the layout is well charted.<br />
An elderly con man to catch security off guard.<br />
</p>
<p>
The demo man creates a strong gust of <span class="blank">___</span>,<br />
And the surveillance man will deliver you a pinch.<br />
A contortionist to get out of a <span class="blank">___</span>,<br />
Who is careful not to miss by an inch.<br />
</p>
<p>
After getting inside there is no need for stealth.<br />
Money in hand, just walk out the door.<br />
Then reunite with the team and celebrate this wealth,<br />
But beware: a man swindled has vengeance in store.<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>
You with the fancy London accent<br />
And I from the valley of fine wine:<br />
Who would have known we&rsquo;d be so Gemini?<br />
In the middle we met and did consent<br />
To plot mischief that our lives would further intertwine,<br />
Trading places perfectly to the eye.<br />
</p>
<p>
Soon we sought cupid&rsquo;s bow<br />
To reveal that woman&rsquo;s greedy lies<br />
And thwart a terrible match. <br />
We brought them together though<br />
And refused to remove our disguise.<br />
First take us camping, that&rsquo;s the catch!<br />
</p>
<p>
Now we share a victor&rsquo;s <span class="blank">___</span>,<br />
And made this family again our <span class="blank">___</span>.<br />
</p>
