The following guidelines should help you assemble your components
properly.  If you don&rsquo;t follow the guidelines, replacements are
available, but we will be cranky.</p>

<ol>
  <li>You need to assemble all of the components.  Plan your
   assembly order accordingly.</li>
  <li>Don&rsquo;t solder the 8-pin IC directly to anything.</li>
</ol>
