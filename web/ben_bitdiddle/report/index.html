Ben Bitdiddle edits theater reviews written by his fleet of critic
bots, who are sent out for the tedious meatspace part of the
job.  Contact HQ to obtain some components he recently posted on
<code>reuse@mit.edu</code>.

<p>
The following guidelines should help you assemble your components
properly.  If you don't follow the guidelines, replacements are
available, but we will be cranky.</p>

<ol>
  <li>You need to assemble all of the components.  Plan your
   assembly order accordingly.</li>
  <li>Don't solder the 8-pin IC directly to anything.</li>
</ol>
