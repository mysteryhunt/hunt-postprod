<p>Teams are invited to send a person or two to play Jenga with us. They play with a normal Jenga tower, except that the pieces are colored in 8 colors. The rules of the game are:</p>


<p>Normal Jenga rules:<br />
&ldquo;On your turn, carefully remove a block from anywhere BELOW the highest completed story. Use only one hand! Then stack the block on top of the tower at right angles to the blocks just below it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mystery Hunt additions:
</p><ul>
<li>When you successfully remove and replace a piece without knocking the tower over, note the color of the piece on your score sheet.</li>
<li>After the game, you will receive a &ldquo;clue word&rdquo; for each color of piece that you have scored _twice in that game_. (Each color will correspond to exactly one clue word.)</li>
<li>You can play as many times as you want.</li>
<li>If you knock over the tower or voluntarily leave the game, you gain one fewer clue word (of your choice).</li>
<li>Minor/accidental violations of the Jenga rules will be punished by a stern warning. Major infractions will be punished by forfeiting the game and a substantial time delay before you can play again.</li>
<li>Trading clue words is not allowed.</li>
</ul>

<p>The 8 clue words form a puzzle. Each word has a unique non-initial letter such that you can move that letter to the front to get a new word (e.g. ENERVATE --&gt; VENERATE). Take those letters in rainbow order (by color of the piece they came from) to spell out the answer, SANDWICH.</p>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>PROUST --&gt; SPROUT (S)</li>
<li>MAPLE --&gt; AMPLE (A)</li>
<li>UNCLEAR --&gt; NUCLEAR (N)</li>
<li>RIDER --&gt; DRIER (D)</li>
<li>AWNING --&gt; WANING (W)</li>
<li>COIN --&gt; ICON (I)</li>
<li>REACTION --&gt; CREATION (C)</li>
<li>EARTH --&gt; HEART (H)</li>
</ul>
