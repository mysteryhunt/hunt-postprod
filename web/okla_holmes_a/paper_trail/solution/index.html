<p>Diagramless crossword given to solvers, but there are 12 extra clues in the mix. 
Solving the puzzle reveals twelve letters sticking out around the edge, spelling 
FRIDAYWAPOST. This directs solvers to the newspaper, which will contain a 
crossword by me. This puzzle can have twelve of its words extended, as well, in the 
same location as the diagramless. They also can be matched up to the extra clues, 
spelling ANSWERBYLINE around the edge of the crossword. The answer is <b>BYLINE</b>.
