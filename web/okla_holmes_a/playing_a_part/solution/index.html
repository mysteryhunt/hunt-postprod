<p>Each phrase from the first column is paired with a phrase from a
second column to form a complete clue. Each correctly formed clue
solves to a two-word answer, where the two words also combine to form
a longer word. (The longer word must have meaning unrelated to either
of the two words. Otherwise this puzzle would be boring.)</p>

<p>The first column is sorted alphabetically, whereas the second column is not, indicating that the second column may be an important ordering for extraction.</p>

<p>Here are the correctly formed clues and answers, in the order given
by the second column:</p>
