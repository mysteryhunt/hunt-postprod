<title>O Blessed Day</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
The text at the top of this puzzle says that, if the world doesn&rsquo;t end this
year, there will be a lot of holidays to celebrate!  This puzzle is about
some of those holidays, from the well-known to the somewhat obscure.</p>

<p>Each of the days in the calendar contains a Latin clue describing
a (usually secular and sometimes humorous) holiday, from the point of
view of residents of the United States.  If you translate these clues
and identify the holidays to which they refer, you can find a
particular date in 2012 on which that holiday will be celebrated
or anniversary will be observed.</p>

<p>
Each of the saints clued by the biography has a feast day observed
on one of the holiday&rsquo;s dates.  By identifying the saints and
matching their feast days to the holiday dates, you can associate
each day in the calendar with one saint.
</p>

<p>
The clues about the saints are needed because multiple saints
can have a feast day on the same day, and some of the saints we&rsquo;ve referred to are rather obscure.
</p>

<p>
The descriptions are mapped this way:
