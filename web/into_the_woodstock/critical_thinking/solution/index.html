Each clue describes a fictional movie formed from two others.  Each movie is formed by taking the first episode of one movie series, and the
second half of an episode from another series, separated by a comma; then one letter is changed in the second half.
</p>
<p>From each title, extract the changed letter, and order them so that the first half of each movie corresponds to the original second
half of the next movie.  The first movie corresponds to the only clue with &ldquo;first&rdquo;, and the last movie corresponds to the only
clue with &ldquo;last&rdquo;.
</p><p>In this list, the movies are presented in order, and the changed letter is in capital.</p>
