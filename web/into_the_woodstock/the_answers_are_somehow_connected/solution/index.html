Each clue matches two possible answers that are also names of MBTA subway stations.
</p>

<p>
To extract a letter from the two answers of each clue, take the shortest distance between the two stations (in number of stops), add the adjustment number given in parentheses, and then convert the sum to a letter using the common A=1 encoding.
</p>

<p>
All of the answers and extraction are shown in the table below.
</p>
