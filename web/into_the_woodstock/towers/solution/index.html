Solving the clues reveals 15 pairs of 5-letter anagrams.  The left column provides the correct 
order, and the alphabetized right column needs to be reordered.

The title image of the puzzle has strong resemblance to a Tower of Hanoi puzzle (which is also 
clued by the title of the puzzle itself).  Solvers should notice that in the image, letters are stacked in 
alphabetical order, and as soon as that becomes impossible, they begin again on the next stack.  </p>
<p>
Every solution word in the puzzle can be written in a similar way (for example, GROAN can be 
written as GR/O/AN and ORGAN can be written as OR/G/AN).  There is never any ambiguity; every word 
fits in one way and uses all three pegs.</p>
<p>
Using the Tower of Hanoi rules, solvers must figure out the fewest number of steps to move 
letters until the first word becomes the second. The number of moves is always between 1 and 26, which 
should lead solvers to an alphanumeric substitution.

The final clue reads GULZAR OSCAR SONG. Gulzar is the pen name of the lyricist of the 2008 Academy 
Award winning &ldquo;Jai Ho&rdquo; (Slumdog Millionaire). Therefore <b>JAI HO</b> is the solution (and is also a five-letter 
string that fits the Tower of Hanoi rule).</p>
