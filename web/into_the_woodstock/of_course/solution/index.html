The answers to the clues are:
<br />
A GIRL LIKE YOU<br />
COMFIER<br />
CONNECTING TRAIN<br />
HOMICIDE<br />
INFANCY GOSPELS<br />
IREX<br />
MAR DEL PLATA<br />
OBSOLETELY<br />
RAW SIENNA<br />
SATORI<br />
THE PASSWORD IS<br />
TUDOR<br />
</p>
<p>
These are A-Z, but they also have unique lengths (4-15). Rearranging by length gives:
</p>

<pre>IREX
TUDOR
SATORI
COMFIER
HOMICIDE
RAWSIENNA
OBSOLETELY
MARDELPLATA
AGIRLLIKEYOU
THEPASSWORDIS
INFANCYGOSPELS
CONNECTINGTRAIN
</pre>

<p>
The first letters spell IT&rsquo;S CHROMATIC, hinting to find the 12-tone chromatic solfege (<a href="http://www.music.vt.edu/musicdictionary/appendix/scales/solmization/syllables.html">link</a>). Re-rearranging by solfege syllable gives:
</p>
<pre>TUDOR
THEPASSWORDIS
IREX
SATORI
HOMICIDE
INFANCYGOSPELS
COMFIER
OBSOLETELY
RAWSIENNA
MARDELPLATA
AGIRLLIKEYOU
CONNECTINGTRAIN
</pre>
<p>
(TUDOR should really be at the bottom since this is an ascending scale, but you get the idea.) The diagonal gives the clue THE O.C. CREATOR who is <b>JOSH SCHWARTZ</b>, the answer to this puzzle.
