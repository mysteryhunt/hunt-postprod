An observant solver who has played StarCraft II may notice some camouflaged references to the Zerg race within the fake subject descriptions. Once this aha is reached, closer inspection should eventually lead to the realization that the clues within each description can be mapped to one of the Zerg structures (buildings). Note the hidden clues may reference units or upgrades that the structure enables. The fact that there are 16 fake subjects and 16 Zerg structures further confirms that this mapping is correct and intentional.

Here are the mappings in the original alphabetical order:
</p>

<table class="c7e-marg-top" id="c7e-t1">
<tbody><tr><th>Subject title</th><th>Subject description</th><th>Clues hidden within</th><th>Associated Zerg structure</th></tr>
<tr><td>Animal Flight I</td><td>Studies two species of flying animals for contrast. Students will be expected to compare their height, weight, flight-enabling appendages, air speed, color, likelihood of each liking the other&rsquo;s color better than their own, and likelihood of being corrupt and cheating at games.</td><td>&rdquo;flying animals&rdquo;; &ldquo;two species&rdquo; (Mutalisk and Corruptor); &ldquo;corrupt&rdquo; (Corruptor)</td><td>Spire</td></tr><tr><td>Animal Flight II</td><td>A follow-up to the previous course of learning. Greater emphasis on specialization in flying creatures. Students attempting to emulate these mechanisms themselves do so at their own risk.</td><td>&rdquo;follow-up to the previous&rdquo; (follow-up to an existing Spire); &ldquo;greater&rdquo; (word is in structure name); &ldquo;specialization in flying creatures&rdquo; (Brood Lord only attacks ground)</td><td>Greater Spire</td></tr><tr><td>Basic Lifeforms I</td><td>Some claim life began in pools of primordial ooze. Others say life began after the universe was bored and wanted someone to talk to. Regardless, what we do know is that even the most basic species were eventually able to develop evolutionary advantages such as increased metabolism and epinephrine production.</td><td>&rdquo;pools&rdquo; (&ldquo;pool&rdquo; is in structure name); &ldquo;most basic species&rdquo; (enables Zergling); &ldquo;increased metabolism and epinephrine production&rdquo; (Metabolic Boost and Adrenal Glands upgrades)</td><td>Spawning Pool</td></tr><tr><td>Basic Lifeforms II</td><td>A continuation of Basic Lifeforms I. This subject covers new research into the most basic species, showing that chemical imbalances in some individuals&rsquo; cells can cause their bodies to bloat and eventually burst. This has also been known to happen to students taking this subject, so caution is advised.</td><td>&rdquo;new research into the most basic species&rdquo; (newer properties of Zergling that were not present in StarCraft I); &ldquo;chemical imbalances in some individuals&rsquo; cells, causing their bodies to bloat and eventually burst&rdquo; (describes Baneling)</td><td>Baneling Nest</td></tr><tr><td>Colony Behavior I</td><td>Surveys bees as the representative example of colony behavior. Studies how colonies expand their reach by having some members leave and establish a new colony, resource gathering by worker bees, and structures for developing the young in their pre-metamorphosis stage.&nbsp;English-to-bee translator available. Students should bring their own bee-to-English translator if desired.</td><td>&rdquo;expand&rdquo; (Hatchery is often first structure built when expanding); &ldquo;resource gathering by worker bees&rdquo;; &ldquo;structures for developing the young in their pre-metamorphosis stage&rdquo;</td><td>Hatchery</td></tr><tr><td>Colony Behavior II</td><td>Surveys bees as the representative example of colony behavior. Examines highly developed hives and their effects in enabling further evolutionary differentiation. This has led to behaviors including the creation of the Bee-52&rsquo;s rock group, the show Bee-witched, and monologues such as To Bee or Not to Bee.</td><td>&rdquo;highly developed&rdquo; (high in the Zerg tech tree); &ldquo;hives&rdquo; (structure name); &ldquo;effects in enabling further evolutionary differentiation&rdquo; (enables further structures and upgrades)</td><td>Hive</td></tr><tr><td>Life Underground I</td><td>Examines the advantages of digging underground for land species, either to hide from enemies and safely rest, or to lie in wait for unsuspecting prey. Also, I&rsquo;ve heard that some sophisticated animal shelters enable their inhabitants to go underground. Don&rsquo;t ask me how that works. I&rsquo;m only a first-year professor. Ask the professor of Life Underground II.</td><td>&rdquo;some sophisticated animal shelters enable their inhabitants to go underground&rdquo; (Burrow upgrade is enabled by Lair)</td><td>Lair</td></tr><tr><td>Life Underground II</td><td>Unlike Life Underground I, this course looks at creatures who spend their whole lifetime underground within sophisticated underground networks that are further extended by each individual.</td><td>&rdquo;networks&rdquo; (&ldquo;network&rdquo; is in structure name); &ldquo;creatures who spend their whole lifetime underground within sophisticated underground networks that are further extended by each individual&rdquo; (describes Nydus Worm)</td><td>Nydus Network</td></tr><tr><td>Nest Protection I</td><td>Would you like to know how animals protect their nests? I bet you would. Nests are cool. Get hands-on by prototyping some structures in lab for protection of nests from aerial predators. Students are requested to bring their own predators for testing.</td><td>&rdquo;structures ... for protection ... from aerial predators&rdquo;</td><td>Spore Crawler</td></tr><tr><td>Nest Protection II</td><td>Get ready to be dazzled. You can now learn to build new structures for protection from terrestrial predators. Students are not required to bring predators, as they will be expected to attack each other&rsquo;s nests for testing.</td><td>&rdquo;structures for protection from terrestrial predators&rdquo;</td><td>Spine Crawler</td></tr><tr><td>Non-Oxygen-Based Lifeforms</td><td>Discusses evolution and lifeforms aided by gases other than oxygen. Lab supplies include gas masks, clean suits, volcano suits, and very long tongs.</td><td>&rdquo;evolution and lifeforms aided by gases other than oxygen&rdquo; (Vespene gas)</td><td>Extractor</td></tr><tr><td>Parasites</td><td>Ewwwwww, parasites. Parasites are gross. Students will learn to classify parasites (temporary vs. permanent, affecting neurological circuits of the host, etc.) and determine the best way to squish, smash, slap, or otherwise get rid of them. Gross.</td><td>&rdquo;parasites&rdquo;; &ldquo;temporary vs. permanent&rdquo; (Neural Parasite vs. Infested Terran); &ldquo;affecting neurological circuits of the host&rdquo; (Neural Parasite)</td><td>Infestation Pit</td></tr><tr><td>Predator Mutations I</td><td>A variety of subjects require students to provide their own predators. Students wishing help in breeding such predators would benefit from this course. For a small lab fee, ineffective predators can be exposed to radiation to garner useful mutations like stronger claws, sharper spines, and tougher shells. Then, a series of specialized exercises will help them make good use of their new modifications.</td><td>&rdquo;stronger claws, sharper spines, and tougher shells&rdquo; (Melee Attacks, Missile Attacks, and Ground Carapace upgrades, respectively)</td><td>Evolution Chamber</td></tr><tr><td>Predator Mutations II</td><td>This subject studies a species of land predators that has adapted to prey in an unusual way: developing the ability to kill prey from a distance by launching spines. There will be mandatory field visits to the species&rsquo;s den for research. Students who get themselves maimed or killed will not receive a passing grade.</td><td>&rdquo;ability to kill prey from a distance by launching spines&rdquo; (describes Hydralisk); &ldquo;den&rdquo; (word is in structure name)</td><td>Hydralisk Den</td></tr><tr><td>Predator Mutations III</td><td>Studies the evolution of massive land predators at the top of the food chain. The professor and TAs will absolutely not be accompanying students on mandatory research trips to the caverns where these beasts reside. Best of luck.</td><td>&rdquo;massive land predators&rdquo; (Ultralisks are the largest Zerg units); &ldquo;caverns&rdquo; (&ldquo;cavern&rdquo; is in structure name)</td><td>Ultralisk Cavern</td></tr><tr><td>Wound Healing</td><td>Suitable for students who are too cowardly to take Predator Mutations II and III but require the extra units. Most animals have evolved the ability to heal wounds by regenerating tissue over time. This subject examines the development of species that have the highest tissue recuperation rates (as measured in the laboratory under ideal conditions).</td><td>&rdquo;species that have the highest tissue recuperation rates (as measured in the laboratory under ideal conditions)&rdquo; (Roach has the fastest regeneration rate when burrowed)</td><td>Roach Warren</td></tr>

The next step is to rearrange the subject titles/descriptions back under the correct subject numbers. Notice that the Zerg tech tree is a dependency graph with the structures (subject descriptions) as the nodes, just as the prereqs for the subject numbers create a dependency graph. The two dependency graphs match up exactly, so that it&rsquo;s possible to determine which subject goes with which number, with only a few exceptions.
</p>

<p class="c7e-list-top">
The exceptions are:
</p>
<ul class="c7e-ul">
<li>The Baneling Nest, Roach Warren, and Spine Crawler all depend on the Spawning Pool but nothing depends on these structures. So it&rsquo;s initially unclear how to assign these three subjects.</li>
<li>Similarly, the Hydralisk Den and Nydus Network both depend on the Lair but nothing depends on these structures, so it&rsquo;s initially unclear how to assign these two subjects.</li>
</ul>
<p class="c7e-list-bot">However, notice that the subject numbers that should match up with these five structures all come with an extra bit of info called the &ldquo;lab time.&rdquo; In fact, the listed &ldquo;lab times&rdquo; are simply the amounts of time it takes to build these five structures. They enable you to disambiguate the mappings for these five structures.

<p class="c7e-marg-top">
The extraction method is to use the digits after the decimal point in each subject number to index into the letters of the subject description.
