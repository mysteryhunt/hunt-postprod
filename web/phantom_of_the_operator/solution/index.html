<p>Answers in specified order:</p>

<pre>1. FIRESTONE
2. CLINTON
3. UNION
4. MERCURY
5. PERSHING
6. CHERRY
7. VALLEY
8. VIKING
9. TERMINAL
</pre>

<p>These are all words from <a href="http://ourwebhome.com/TENP/Recommended.html">Ma Bell&#8217;s list of
Officially Recommended Exchange Names</a> (<a href="Telephone_EXchange_Names.html">archive copy</a>), which solvers
are hinted to find from the round title (and which Google will show
with a large enough set). The first two letters give the beginning of
the phone number prefix, so FI-CL-UN-ME-PE-CH-VA-VI-TE get translated
via phone code (2=ABC, 3=DEF, 4=GHI, etc), yielding the string:</p>
<pre>  34-25-86-63-73-24-82-84-83
</pre>
<p>which can be translated back to letters (I used
<a href="http://www.phonespell.org/">phonespell.org</a>
but there are several), giving the answer:
<b>DIAL TONE RECITATIVE</b>.</p>
