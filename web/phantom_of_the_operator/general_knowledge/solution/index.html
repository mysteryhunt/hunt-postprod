Clued by the title and by the fact that the questions are all asked in
iambic octameter, each question refers to a different line (or part of
line) of the &ldquo;Modern General&rsquo;s Song&rdquo; from <i>The
Pirates of Penzance</i>. Solvers must then put the answers to the
questions in order based on their content&rsquo;s position in the
song, and group them into quatrains just as the puzzle is presented:
