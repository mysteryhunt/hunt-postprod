Each of these cartoons depict the result when you take the title of a country song and reverse the words, with some liberties taken for homophones (the puzzle title comes from the old joke:  What do you get when you play a country song backwards?  You get your job back, you get your dog back, you get your wife back&hellip;)
</p>
<p>
The spaces below each cartoon fit the enumeration of the artist who performed the song (in reverse order, of course).  All of the songs are listed below:
</p>

Crowd every in one &ndash; gentry Montgomery<br />
Middle the in meat &ndash; rio diAmond<br />
Airplanes watching &ndash; allan garY<br />
Is it whatever? &ndash; Band brown zac<br />
Byes:  Good, Little &ndash; shEdaisy<br />
Places low in friends &ndash; brooks gaRth<br />
On Boots &ndash; houser Randy<br />
Moon the rope &ndash; montgomerY michael john<br />
Bone Drinkin&rsquo; &ndash; byrd traCy<br />
Green Dear John &ndash; diffie jOe<br />
Cinderella Stealing &ndash; wicKs chuck<br />
Fly to Bourne &ndash; Evans sara<br />

<p>
If you take the letters in red from the spaces (represented by capitals above), it spells out &lsquo;MAYBERRY COKE&rsquo;.  In the song &lsquo;Mayberry&rsquo; by Rascal Flatts (or Flatts Rascal&hellip;), they mention CHERRY coke, so the answer is <b>CHERRY</b>.
