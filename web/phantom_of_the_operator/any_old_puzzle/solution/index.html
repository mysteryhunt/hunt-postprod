<p>Each clue resolves to a word containing only the letters A, N, and Y.  (The clue &ldquo;cat&rdquo; reveals the hidden <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QH2-TGUlwu4">theme</a> of this puzzle, and the reason for the otherwise arbitrary use of Pop-Tart flavors for reference strings.)  From the first group of indexes you can infer how strings are converted to numbers: you list all of the possible strings formed from these letters, sorted first by length and then alphabetically, and take the index in the list.  So:</p>

<p>A = 1<br />
N = 2<br />
Y = 3<br />
AA = 4<br />
AN = 5<br />
...</p>

<p>(This is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortlex_order">length-plus-lexicographic order</a> typically used to enumerate all finite strings with a given alphabet; starting with 1 is natural because the empty string should have value 0.)  Doing the math and indexing reveals the answer, <b>FIRESTONE</b>.  In detail:</p>
