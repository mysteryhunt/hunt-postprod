<p>Each of the speeches contains a set of three statements that make
up a classical syllogism. The syllogisms are all formally invalid, so
the correctness of the reasoning is not the point. Instead, each has a
logical form that corresponds to one of the names of the contestants,
using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllogism">mnemonic
system</a> developed by medieval scholars. Here is a brief description
of the system:</p>

<p>In a syllogism, each of three propositions links two terms using
one of four possible quantifiers (all, no, some, and some ... not),
and each term appears exactly twice. </p>

<p>Syllogisms can be put into a standard form by first identifying the
conclusion for which the speaker is arguing. This conclusion asserts a
truth about some set (the &ldquo;minor term&rdquo;) by describing its
relationship to a second set (the &ldquo;major term&rdquo;). So the
claim, &ldquo;Some Greeks are mortals,&rdquo; has &ldquo;Greeks&rdquo;
as a minor term and &ldquo;mortals&rdquo; as a major term. Of the
other two propositions, the &ldquo;major premise&rdquo; is the one in
which the major term appears and the &ldquo;minor premise&rdquo; is
the one in which the minor term appears. (The &ldquo;middle
term&rdquo; is the one which appears in the major and minor premises
but not in the conclusion.) In the standard form, the order is: major
premise, minor premise, conclusion.</p>

<p>The name code classifies syllogisms by describing the quantifiers in the three premises. It assigns a vowel to each of the four possible quantifiers:</p>

<p> A ALL X are Y <br />
 E NO X are Y<br />
 I SOME X are Y<br />
 O SOME X are NOT Y</p>

<p>A mnemonic name will have three vowels from {A,E,I,O} in order, corresponding to the quantifiers in the three premises. (Syllogisms are also classified by &ldquo;figure,&rdquo; which describes the order of the terms in the major and minor premises, but there is no similarly entertaining mnemonic for the figure.) Each of the contestants&rsquo; names have this property, which enables them to be paired off with their speeches. Taking the speeches in the order given by the score sheet, and word-indexing into the speeches by the contestants&rsquo; scores spells out a message:</p>
