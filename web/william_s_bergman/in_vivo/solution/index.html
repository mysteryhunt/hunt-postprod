<p>This is a puzzle about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vi">vi editor</a>.  It was inspired by the
<a href="http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/06/endgame.html">2006 Mystery Hunt endgame puzzle</a> where teams were supposed to type the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/06/metas/washington.html">text</a></p>

<p>into NetHack, where, interpreted as a series of NetHack commands, it would
get their character out of a sticky situation.</p>

<p>Here, solvers have to do roughly the reverse: given an editing problem,
they need to find the fastest solution to that problem in vi (that is,
the smallest number of keystrokes that will accomplish the given editing
task).  Note that the &ldquo;task&rdquo; does not consist only in making the buffer
contain particular text; it also requires ending with a particular cursor
position, and ending in insert mode or command mode, as indicated.  To the
best of our knowledge, the solutions here are the unique absolute minimum
number of keystrokes required, and (although the screenshots are taken from
<a href="http://www.vim.org/">vim</a>) will work in any version of vi.</p>

<p>The solutions to these editing problems also happen to form English
words, which are given in alphabetical order for confirmation.

<a href="sol1.html">Click here to see the solutions</a> (which are too
wide for this page).</p>

<p>Many of the letters in the words are numbered with an acrostic-like
ordering.  Putting these letters in the specified order gives the
apparently meaningless string</p>

<blockquote><strong>dtgerybrntuhdefolrehxdebpwctoarn</strong></blockquote>

<p>This string is also a series of vi editing commands which
must be performed from the starting point given in the final editing
problem.  (It actually means &ldquo;delete up to next &lsquo;g&rsquo;; go to end of word; replace
character with &lsquo;y&rsquo;; go back to beginning of word; replace character with
&lsquo;n&rsquo;; go up to next &lsquo;u&rsquo;; go left; delete to end of word; go to next &lsquo;o&rsquo;; go
right; replace character with &lsquo;e&rsquo;; go left; delete character; delete to end of
word; go back to beginning of word; paste back deletion buffer after
current character position; go to beginning of next word; change up to
next &lsquo;o&rsquo; with text &lsquo;arn&rsquo;&rdquo;.)</p>
