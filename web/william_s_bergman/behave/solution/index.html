<dl>
	<dt><em>All five vowels</em></dt>
	<dd><pre>ANNIE PROULX, COMMUTATIVE, HUGO WEAVING, MOUNTAIN DEW, MOZAMBIQUE, SEQUOIA</pre></dd>

	<dt><em>Same vowel/consonant pattern (VCCVCVCVVC)</em></dt>
	<dd><pre>ANNOTATION, ARTIFICIAL, ENGINE ROOM, INDIVIDUAL, OMNIVOROUS, ON LOCATION</pre></dd>
	
	<dt><em>Letters in alphabetical order</em></dt>
	<dd><pre>ALMOST, BIOPSY, CHIMP, FILMS, GHOST, TUX</pre></dd>
	
	<dt><em>Every pair of letters is a bigram in the alphabet</em></dt>
	<dd><pre>BALKED, BAR SPOON, HIGH NOON, KLUTZY, ONYX, POSTED</pre></dd>
</dl>

<p>There is a single 10-letter string that obeys all 4 properties: ABDEHINOUV. Using this as the keyword of a Playfair square, we obtain:</p>

<pre>ABDEH
INOUV
CFGKL
MPQRS
TWXYZ
</pre>

<p>The cipher text now can be decoded:</p>

<pre>GI MP VQ DY RO VT
CO SM OS EX QU IZ
</pre>

<p>Giving the answer, <b>COSMO SEX QUIZ</b>.</p>
