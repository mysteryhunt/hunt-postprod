<p>In the first half of the puzzle, the 17 words from the 8 round
answers each map cryptogram-style to one of the partial show titles on
the left halves of the tickets, with the set of words in each
multi-word answer all matching within a set of grouped tickets.  Nine
of the tickets' Row letters do not appear in the partial title of the
show, but do appear in the corresponding round answer (these, as it
happens, are the tickets that do not pair up to make longer show
titles).  Find the Row letter in the corresponding answer and take the
letter from the show title used to encode that letter; reading those
letters in order by Seat number gives NO OVERLAP, a clue as to what to
do in the second half of this meta.</p>

<p>The other eight tickets are from shows that Bergman liked, and all
have right-half counterparts.  In these tickets, the Row letter
appears in the partial title of the show but not the round answer.
Find the letter in the title and take the corresponding letter from
the answer word; reading those letters in order by Seat number gives
CAST HUGE, the first half of the meta answer.<p>

<p>As for the right halves of the tickets, the clue NO OVERLAP hints
that we must match answers with shows they have no letters in common
with.  The eight new answers from the critic puzzles each match
exactly one right ticket half, and one left ticket half, with which
the answer has no letters in common.  Once appropriately matched, the
answers and completed show titles almost form pangrams; each one
contains exactly 24 letters of the alphabet.  The Row letter on each
right ticket half accounts for one of the missing letters; taking the
other remaining missing letter and ordering by Seat numbers gives TV
ACTORS, the second half of the meta answer.</p>

<p>The surest way to displease William S. Bergman, then, is to <b>CAST
HUGE TV ACTORS</b>, whose popularity he is sure to despise.</p>
