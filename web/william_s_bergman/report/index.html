<p><i>
William S. Bergman is the hippest reviewer out there.  If a show is
experimental and incomprehensible, he's sure to like it so much he'll
go see it twice, just so he can save both halves of the ticket.  But
if he doesn't feel it's an important work, he'll only see it once. (We
couldn't say how he feels about shows he doesn't see.)
