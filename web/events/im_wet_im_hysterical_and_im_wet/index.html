Actors on the stage need exercise to keep their bodies fit and to keep their memories sharp for memorizing those lines.  That&rsquo;s right, the Event that you all signed up for and are eagerly awaiting: swimming!  Pick two team members from the members that signed up and come to the Alumni Pool at 1:30pm (pool facilities are not open before then so don&rsquo;t come early).  Please come already in your swimsuits so that we can start the Event promptly.  The facilities do have locker-rooms to store street clothes in, but no locks, so don&rsquo;t bring any valuables.  You must be 18 or older to attend this Event.

Note: if your team did not register for this Event ahead of time, you
cannot come into the pool building.  Only those whose names are on the
list will be let into the building.  We're sorry, but those are the
rules of the pool.
