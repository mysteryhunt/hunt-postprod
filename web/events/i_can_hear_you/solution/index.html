Explanation at the event:
</p>
<p>
Welcome to the B&amp;B good communication and team-building event. In a moment you will be asked to relay messages to your teammate while one of you is on the north end of Lobdell and the other is on the south end. Please observe the following rules:
</p>
<p>
One of you will be on the balcony, one on the main level. You may change who is at which position during breaks, but you cannot change sides.
Do not take any action that may be construed as dangerous to any participants or would cause damage to property.
</p>
<p>
The center of Lobdell is a neutral zone for meeting with your teammates during the appointed breaks. 
</p>
<p>
Place your wireless device on the tables behind you on the balcony or floor. These can only be used for entering words and viewing the next word. Only use your own device unless otherwise instructed.
</p>
<p>
You may use any of the approved materials you brought. We&rsquo;ve also provided paper if you need it.
</p>
<p>
At the appointed time, enter the password and receive a word (or wait for a word). Relay this message exactly including spelling, punctuation, and capitalization. The message must cross directly through Lobdell and not be transmitted via wireless or phone signal. Once you receive the message, type it into your page for confirmation. If the answer is correct, you will get the next word to relay back. Continue in this way until time is up for each round.
</p>
<p>
If you are done before time is up, you may meet in the neutral zone to prep the next round. 
</p>
<p>
There will be 5 minute breaks in between rounds; we suggest that you use this time to discuss strategy, drink water, etc. You may also use this time to complete your current word if you wish, but it will eat into your prep time for the next round, so use your time well.
