The puzzle is a series of 11 pictures of board games in progress. Each game, when examined carefully, has a numerical mistake -- one number is replaced with another number.

Indexing into the game names in order by the correct numbers, we get FIRSTDESIGN. Looking up the designer of each board game and finding the first board game design he or she published leads to this table:

We have already used the missing numbers to get FIRSTDESIGN. Now, using the incorrect numbers to index into each designer&rsquo;s first game leads to <b>SCHRODINGER</b>, which is the answer.

<h3>Bonus Material</h3>

In developing Highlights, we put together a number of board game scenarios that were not ultimately used in production. If you enjoyed solving Highlights and want more, check out these bonus game scenarios. Just like the 11 pictures in Highlights, each bonus picture should solve to a number that is incorrect in the scenario.
