Developing a Battle Line scenario was thematically fun because of its proof mechanic, which is core to its gameplay. This mechanic was similar to the reasoning we had to use in some of the actual puzzle&rsquo;s game scenarios, to be sure that a game had a single specific error.

<br /><br />In this scenario, the top player has claimed with a 6, 9, 10 against an empty column. This move is not legal. But if the 6 had been a 9, the player could have proved that he would win that column, and claimed it. This error, we concluded, was slightly odd because the error could also be interpretted as the top player illegally claiming the column. Playing the 6 in that column was a perfectly legal move, but claiming the column was illegal. In addition, there was some ambiguity about Reiner Knizia&rsquo;s first design. So, much as I would have liked to represent Knizia in this puzzle, we dropped Battle Line.
