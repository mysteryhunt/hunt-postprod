In this Endeavor scenario, the green player is listed as having 9 shields, but reviewing his board position and tokens collected indicates he should only have 2 shields. In some of the scenarios that we used, we had to fix the game state to happen towards the beginning of the game, so that more was provably correct about the game board. I liked how much was going on in this game board, and how late in the game we were. Unfortunately, we decided that using Endeavor was confusing because it had two designers. Using the first design of the two designers collectively was inelegant. Endeavor was designed by Carl de Visser, and Jarratt Gray. Carl de Visser&rsquo;s first game was Final Decrees.
