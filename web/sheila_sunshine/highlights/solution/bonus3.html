Here is another Vegas Showdown scenario. In this scenario, only 2 premier tiles are present, rather than the requisite 3 premier tiles. The Vegas scenario that we used in Highlights was straightforward -- a simple scoring error. I liked this more complex scenario more, but we had trouble getting it past our test solvers.
