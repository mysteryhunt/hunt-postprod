The first thing to realise is that all of the rats are alums of the MIT mystery hunt.  Therefore each of their reminisces is referencing the title of a previous mystery hunt puzzle.  So for example, Claude H. Chinchilla studied [RADIO WAVES], Franklin Shrew got into [DISARRAY] at MIT. The reference to Xavier Gerbils studying Castor and Pollux at the highest level is meant to refer to the Castor and Pollux Meta from 2009.  Similarly the two references to getting fully trained on the 2003 puzzles reflect that there were &ldquo;untrained&rdquo; and &ldquo;trained&rdquo; answers to these puzzles. There should be plenty of paths into recognising this for what it is, so the first thing we do is that we look us the solutions to all of the previous puzzles:

Now we match the years/alumni to the brass rat images and look at the fake rat name.  It has an identical enumeration and pattern as the actual alumnus.  The fake name and the real name have exactly one letter in common.

**MIT&rsquo;s websites claim that he got his SB in 1986 and his SM in 1987.  The Washington Post reports that he got both in 1987.  The Post is wrong.
<br />
The common letters spell &ldquo;MOST POPULAR SCHOOL AT MIT&rdquo;.
<br />
That would be the school of <b>ENGINEERING</b>.
