Solvers are presented with
crypto-quotes made up of the 7 colors of the rainbow, along with a short string
of positive/negative numbers. The trick is that each color represents
sequential chunks of the alphabet (Red=A-D, Orange=E-H, Yellow=I-L, Green=M-P, Blue=Q-T,
Indigo=U-X, Violet=Y &amp; Z). Discovering this pattern and solving the quotes
reveals lines spoken by various Muppets. Identify the speaker of the quote,
then convert the colors that make up the speaker&rsquo;s name using the given strings
of numbers (which tell how many color groups and which direction to shift).
Convert the new colors to a final word. The final words form the word ANSWER
and two &ldquo;words that can come before&rdquo; clues whose answers are START
and OVER, so the answer is <b>START OVER</b>.
