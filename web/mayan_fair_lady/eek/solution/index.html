<p>The puzzle is a 3-D maze. After traversing the route from blue to red, color in the squares that have been traversed (these have been &ldquo;hollowed out&rdquo; because they are eaten). You may notice a message embedded in the top layer of the puzzle:
</p>

<pre> #   # # #   #       #         
 #   #               #   # # # 
 #   # # #   #   # # #   # # # 
 #       #   #   #   #   #   
 #   # # #   #   # # #     # # 
 #                              
 #           #               
 #   # # #   #   # # #   #   # 
 #   # # #   #   # # #   #   # 
 #   #       #   #       #   # 
 #     # #   #     # #   # # 
 #                            
 # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # 
 # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # 
 # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # 
 </pre>

<p>This reads &ldquo;Side elev&rdquo;, indicating that you should look at the SIDE ELEVATION of the puzzle.</p>

<p>Notice that many entire rows and columns of the maze are entirely traversed by the maze solution route. Looked at from the side, these rows and columns correspond to pixels in the side elevation that are &ldquo;transparent&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The X-Z and Y-Z elevations of the maze are as follows, where hashes indicate columns or rows, respectively, where every cell is traversed:</p>

<pre> #
 #       # # #   #   #     # # # 
 #       #   #   #   #     # # # 
 #       #   #   #   #     # 
 # # #   # # #     #         # # 

 # # # 
 #         #     # # # 
 # #     # # #   # 
 #         #     # 
 # # #     # #   # # #
</pre>

<p>This reads <b>LOVE ETC</b>, the solution to the puzzle.</p>

<p>The following images display the path with arrows, and then the hollowed out portions of the maze with spraypaint.</p>
