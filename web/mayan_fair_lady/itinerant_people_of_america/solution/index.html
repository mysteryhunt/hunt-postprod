Hinted at by the title and by the phrase oral tradition, solvers must determine that the code depicted is an
IPA cipher. The code deciphers to reveal a subset of John Hodgman&rsquo;s list of 700 hobos from his book Areas
of My Expertise in numerical order. By taking the difference between the numbers of subsequent hobos and
converting those numbers alphanumerically into letters, solvers receive the message PLEASE READ JOHN
HODGMAN&rsquo;S FRIDAY BLOG POST. On the first day of the Mystery Hunt, John Hodgman (will have)
posted a blog entry on his web site (<a href="http://areasofmyexpertise.com/">http://areasofmyexpertise.com</a>). In his trademark style, Hodgman has capitalized several words in his blog post, spelling the secret message THE ANSWER IS <b>BUSINESS TRAVELERS</b>.
