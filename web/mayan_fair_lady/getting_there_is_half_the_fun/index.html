<p>
With so many elaborate honeymoon travel plans, I do hope Father approves the match. Still, I&rsquo;ve graduated now, and I feel like I&rsquo;m so near my goal, and getting nearer to it all the time! Let&rsquo;s just keep some basic rules of travel in mind. The best day to travel is Thursday the 12th, January 2012, as early in the morning as possible (unless you&rsquo;re flying, in which case you can travel any day, at any time).
