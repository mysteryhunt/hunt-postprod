<i>Did you know you can sing any sonnet to the tune of Phantom of the Opera?  At least if the sonnet has an extra &ldquo;inside your mind&rdquo; every now and again.</i></p>

<p>
All the cats r mine for me 2 caption and 2 send.<br />
It&rsquo;s a fine pastime, although not everyone comprehends<br />
That a bicycle that&rsquo;s invisible is both amusing and sublime.<br />
And if cats of mine cannot spell it is not a crime.<br />
</p>
<p>
Apparently the voters won&rsquo;t be voting for Cain; his campaign&rsquo;s run aground;<br />
And Rick Perry&rsquo;s brand new ad could make just anyone cuss and start looking downtown<br />
For a candidate to save them who at least has a brain, and who won&rsquo;t make a fuss, cause they&rsquo;re passably sane. So explain and discuss this dumb primary.<br />
</p>
<p>
Commas don&rsquo;t need to be copious.<br />
Did you reread the first draft?<br />
Please go and do a find/replace<br />
To fix up all the lower case!<br />
Like the word &ldquo;like&rdquo; is quite odious,<br />
Passives are massively poor.<br />
Don&rsquo;t call me Hitler for grammar, please.<br />
But remember that I&rsquo;m keeping score!<br />
</p>
<p>
Everything that I am hearing from the used car guy--<br />
It&rsquo;s all a lie.  What do they mean they promise a good buy?<br />
I give up on dealing with this game of hidden charges, extra fees.<br />
I will buy a car on Craigslist-- that should be a breeze.<br />
</p>
<p>
I dyed my hair blue.<br />
I hope you like this new hue too.<br />
Though some might say &ldquo;boo&rdquo;,<br />
I really hope most agree.<br />
Shrug off the rare few<br />
Who say my head&rsquo;s floating at sea.<br />
This is my way of showing esprit.<br />
</p>
<p>
I sent that letter, hoping for better.<br />
I won&rsquo;t be here again-- it&rsquo;s time to start my life.<br />
I&rsquo;ve put my dreams in, something I trust in,<br />
Time to be clear again-- it&rsquo;s time to start my life.<br />
</p>
<p>
This dress looked utterly perfect &lsquo;til I was in it.<br />
I only tried it on for mere moments, that&rsquo;s clear.<br />
Now I&rsquo;m on What Not To Wear and headed to win it.<br />
Bartender, will you pour me a beer?<br />
</p>
<p>
Why are you up in your room, cowering here in your own den?<br />
Is it because your father&rsquo;s caught you pinching stone fruit now and then?<br />
If he enters with a stick, well then a beating surely comes.<br />
And you know this is all because you were stealing plums!<br />
</p>
<p>
Why won&rsquo;t Sparky glow? He says he&rsquo;d rather hiss;<br />
It starts to make us know that something is amiss.<br />
Well, one firefly will not be missed...<br />
</p>
<p>
With a rat on a stick,<br />
Or a floating nose,<br />
Plus a wishing ring,<br />
And elven thieves,<br />
Shall we play this game, sitting in the basement?<br />
In our circle, it&rsquo;s Munchkin we play.<br />
</p>
<p>
Yes, sir, I worship Athena.<br />
(In truth I don&rsquo;t care for Jesus.)<br />
She gives me wisdom without resistance;<br />
I&rsquo;m always thankful for her assistance.<br />
</p>
