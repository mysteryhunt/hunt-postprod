<p>This puzzle is completely contained in its title.</p>

<p>When you type the title on a keyboard, you ought to notice that
almost all the letters are on the home row.</p>

<p>If you connect the letters typed with lines on a picture of a qwerty keyboard
(ignoring spaces), you will draw an arrow:</p>

<pre>              I
 A S D F G H J K L
              M
</pre>

<p>The arrow points to one particular key. Since the title was in all caps, you
should hold down shift while pressing this key, producing a <b>COLON</b>.</p>
