<p>This puzzle refers to a common tradition at science fiction conventions, where people take turns reading from the famously bad fantasy story <a href="http://www.rdrop.com/~hutch/argon">The Eye of Argon</a> until they crack up.  The excerpts from the story have been replaced by humming, but with the aid of the intonation patterns and the topical judge&#8217;s comments, one can reconstruct them:</p>

<tr><td>...slightest chance of sucess.  Anguish continued to mount as his means of occupation...</td><td>I could see the laughter mounting too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>...Grignr slid his crimsoned blade from Agfnd&#8217;s rib cage.  The fat prince stood undulating...</td><td>Rocking side to side with the hilarity.</td></tr>

<p>The relevant word in each excerpt is the last one, as clued by the fading in of the sound clips (and as is appropriate thematically, as it&#8217;s the word which caused the reader to crack up).  The acrostic of these words spells WE HAVE BROUGHT THIS BLANK BEFORE YOU; this again matches the story, with the answer, <b>YOKEL</b>, filling in the blank.</p>
