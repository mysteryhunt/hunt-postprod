<p>This puzzle refers to a common tradition at science fiction conventions, where people take turns reading from the famously bad fantasy story <a href="http://www.rdrop.com/~hutch/argon">The Eye of Argon</a> until they crack up.  The excerpts from the story have been replaced by humming, but with the aid of the intonation patterns and the topical judge&rsquo;s comments, one can reconstruct them:</p>

<tr><td>...naked but for a golden, jeweled harness enshrouding her huge outcropping...</td><td>Now you&rsquo;re probably wondering, &ldquo;How does he know about the size of her local rock formation?&rdquo;</td></tr>
<tr><td>Notwithstanding these relics of antiquity, its efficiency remained unimpinged.</td><td>Notwithstanding those big words, that makes no sense.</td></tr>
<tr><td>All knowledge of measuring time had escaped Grignr.</td><td>Well then at least Grignr can&rsquo;t measure how long you laughed at that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>...a squatting statue, providing of course that the idol can even be hefted...</td><td>...and, of course, that you can keep a straight face.</td></tr>
<tr><td>...listless dreary silence. -3 1/2- A tightly rung elliptical circle or torches...</td><td>Who knew elementary geometry could be that funny?</td></tr>
<tr><td>...reverberated from his ear drums.  Seemingly utilizing the speed of thought...</td><td>It&rsquo;s three times ten to the eight giggles per second, obviously.</td></tr>
<tr><td>...his outstretched arms while slowly twisting his right hand clockwise and his left hand...</td><td>Afterward, Grignr did the hokey pokey and turned himself around.</td></tr>
<tr><td>...until the man was reduced to a blubbering mass of squirming, insensate...</td><td>Yup, that&rsquo;s blubbering, alright.</td></tr>
<tr><td>...was capable of arousing the numbing sensation of fear inside of Grignr&rsquo;s smoldering soul.</td><td>Well, it was capable of tickling your funny bone, at least.</td></tr>
<tr><td>...ways warped and distorted, but what is your calling,&rdquo; she queried, bustily?</td><td>As in &ldquo;to bust out laughing&rdquo;, apparently.</td></tr>
<tr><td>...ledalong a stone pathway bordered by plush vegitation lustfully...</td><td>Got a thing for furry carrots, huh?</td></tr>
<tr><td>...toppled to the floor, as the segregated torso of Grignr&rsquo;s bovine antagonist...</td><td>Alright, alright, don&rsquo;t have a cow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>...and alternately interposed into the female a strong sensation of stomach curdling nausea.</td><td>No no, curdling it, not clutching it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>...commanded the pudgy noble of Grignr.  &ldquo;By the surly beard of Mrifk, Grignr kneels...&rdquo;</td><td>That&rsquo;s some serious facial hair.</td></tr>
<tr><td>...locked in a searing feral blaze toward the swaying soldier. &ldquo;To hell with you, braggard!&rdquo;</td><td>They do say the road to hell is paved with laughter, right?</td></tr>
<tr><td>...cobwebs cluttering its inner recesses, yet the stygian cloud of charcoal ebony...</td><td>Jim must have looked up &ldquo;dark&rdquo; in his thesaurus.  Maybe I should look up &ldquo;easily amused&rdquo;.</td></tr>
<tr><td>...fiery maned comet, his flabs of jellied blubber pulsating to and fro in ripples of flowing...</td><td>Sounds like ripples of laughter if you ask me.</td></tr>
<tr><td>...death he had unwittingly sprung.  &ldquo;Mrifk!&rdquo;  If not for his keen auditory organs...</td><td>On the other hand, mine don&rsquo;t have to be very keen to hear you breaking down over there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>...Grignr and his sire, but found a sword blade permeating the length of his ribs...</td><td>Quite a rib-tickler indeed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>...featuring in their centers blood red rubys which resembled crimson fetish eyeballs...</td><td>Gemstones, body parts, same thing, right?</td></tr>
<tr><td>...faintly muffled scream of horrified desperation.  His hair prickled yawkishly...</td><td>You should have tried harder to muffle that giggling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>...slightest chance of sucess.  Anguish continued to mount as his means of occupation...</td><td>I could see the laughter mounting too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>...Grignr slid his crimsoned blade from Agfnd&rsquo;s rib cage.  The fat prince stood undulating...</td><td>Rocking side to side with the hilarity.</td></tr>

<p>The relevant word in each excerpt is the last one, as clued by the fading in of the sound clips (and as is appropriate thematically, as it&rsquo;s the word which caused the reader to crack up).  The acrostic of these words spells WE HAVE BROUGHT THIS BLANK BEFORE YOU; this again matches the story, with the answer, <b>YOKEL</b>, filling in the blank.</p>
