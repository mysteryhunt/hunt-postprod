<p>ANSWER: ADOBO</p>

<p>The first thing to do is to identify the various foods being
cooked. Each of them is named for a particular place or region. To
make ID easier, the dishes are in alphabetical order.</p>

<p>There are two key observations: </p>

<p>Each of the script clips contains exactly one number</p>

<p>Each of the script clips begins with a different
letter of the alphabet, A-Y</p>

<p>We use the number as an index into the location word. We use the
alphabetic letter to provide the ordering.</p>

<p>Reordering alphabetically by first word, we get: PHILIPPINE
VINEGAR MARINADE. Which is <b>ADOBO</b>, our answer.</p>

<td>X-raying this mass of
meat would reveal the long thin iron skewer impaled directly through the
middle. Actually mounting the
hand-minced lamb along the skewer is a <span class="number">two</span>-handed
process, with the off (usually the left) hand controlling the skewer while
the main (usually the right) hand manipulates the meat. This is actually the hardest part of the recipe to get right. If not done properly, the meat will
separate from the skewer during grilling.</td>

tightly, before we rinse them and hang them on the rails to dry out before
the curing, with some <span class="number">eight</span> pairs on each rail. Depending on
the weather, they will take most of an hour to cook.</td>

about <span class="number">six</span> minutes until it reaches a
pouring consistency, and now we simply pour it onto the top layer of
sponge letting it run down over the sides. Down over the vanilla
custard in the middle. Look at that. This is why this dish was
declared the official state dessert.</td>

hands as well as the thumb to achieve control of the breast during
the wrap.</td>

<td>The mixture is now carefully stirred. We want the pieces soaking up
the sauce and allowing the flavours of the ginger, turmeric, garam
masala, tamarind, chili, and the rest of the spices to infuse into
the meat. We will cover it and let this Southern Indian dish simmer
for a while until the chicken is tender, stirring about
every <span class="number">four</span> minutes or so.</td>

<td>Chicken Marengo</td>
<td><p>Now we carefully slice the breast into strips. Of course, it is
reported that that the original chef chopped up the chicken with a
sabre. But that is going a little too far today. After all, getting
this wrong today will not result in death on the battlefield. </p>
<p>This next step needs <span class="number">four</span> of our
ingredients. While holding the chicken with the left hand, cut it into
quarter inch slices.</p>
<p>Note: The battlefield reference is an allusion to
Napoleon&rsquo;s insistence that this is lucky food that must be served before
every battle (it was served just before his victory at Marengo and every
battle thereafter).</p></td>

Note: Chicken Parmigiana
literally means &ldquo;Chicken of Parma&rdquo;, but this is actually a southern Italian
dish from nowhere near Parma</td>
<td>Great. Now we are ready to add the sliced or shredded mozzarella
on top of the sauce. <span class="number">One</span> thing we keep in
mind is that we try to place the cheese directly over the cutlets
rather than let it get in the spaces between them.</td>

plenty.</td>

<td>Insalata Caprese</td>
<td>We then slice the fresh mozzarella into medium thin slices, trying
to make them the same rough thickness as our vine ripened
tomatoes. These <span class="number">two</span> flavors, the
mozzarella and the pomodoro will play off of each other in the
mouth.</td>

<td>Irish Stew</td>
<td>...exactly like that. Now we let it simmer for several
hours. While neck mutton chops are more traditional, we use neck lamb
today. This is <span class="number">one</span> of the few changes that
we are making in this traditional recipe.</td>

<td>Lady Baltimore Cake</td>
<td>Dissolve the sugar completely in the water bringing the syrup
mixture to a boil. While the syrup is boiling, beat the egg whites
with a pinch of salt until they hold soft peaks and with the mixer
running add the hot syrup in a stream. Beat in the vanilla and beat
the icing until it is cool. Now we fold in the chopped figs, the
chopped pecans, <span class="number">three</span> teaspoons of vanilla
extract, and the raisins.</td>

<td>London Broil<br />

Note: This is an American cut of meat, unknown in London, England</td>
<td>Very thinly, slice across the grain into diagonal slices. Serve at
least <span class="number">three</span> slices per person. And this
should be the first time you cut into the meat. Scoring or otherwise
penetrating the cut before cooking will result in a tougher dish, for
it would allow the juices to run out of the meat.</td>

<td>Mississippi Mud Pie</td>
<td>Right. Mix in the nuts (often pecans, as we are using today), and
sometimes a tablespoon of vanilla into the cocoa, eggs, sugar and
flour mixture. This will make our bottom layer, which we will cover
with a dark chocolate based topping later
on. <span class="number">One</span> thing we should check is that we
have prepared our spring form cases so that... </td>

spring onions. The light crepes are then rolled and eaten
immediately. <span class="number">One</span> trick during the
preparation is to blow air under the skin. When done properly, there
will be virtually no fat left under the skin.</td>

vinaigrette</td>

(from Bologna)</td>
<td>OK, by this point the meat is well browned and we can add the dry
red wine. We want to cook it until the wine is completely
absorbed. When that happens and the meat may just be beginning to dry
out a bit, we will add the tomato paste, stir that through for
about <span class="number">five</span> minutes, add salt, and then
leave the ragu to simmer on a very, very low heat for another hour and
a half, possibly adding the beef stock as required.</td>

<td>Up to about an inch they would still be considered a traditional
size, unlike for example the big Greek variants. We will want
some <span class="number">five</span> tablespoons of lingonberry jam
to serve with these when they are done cooking. Though you can also
use cranberry or red currant jelly if you cannot get lingonberry.</td>

<td>Quite carefully wait until the mixture is golden brown, then add
one and a half tablespoons of the rosewater for flavouring, and
ensure that this is well whisked in. How long will we need to whisk
it? That depends on how it is coming along. A few minutes is too
little, <span class="number">three</span> hours is too much, and
everything in the middle you have to judge by eye and by nose.</td>

<td>You want to grasp the pot firmly, and then spoon the sauce
directly onto the toast. The sauce should be thick and smooth by this

strong beer, strong cheddar cheese and other ingredients mixed
thoroughly into the roux.</td>
