The other day, I was playing cards backstage at a production of &ldquo;Seussical&rdquo; with three fellow cast and crew members (actress siblings Ri and Ani Ng, and the stage manager, nicknamed &ldquo;Her&rdquo;). Bored with the usual games, I offered to teach them how to play Tichu. I partnered with Ani, while Ri and Her formed the other team.
</p>

<p>
They picked up the game quickly, but given that they were beginners, they didn&rsquo;t play very expertly. In particular, they declared &ldquo;Tichu&rdquo; far too often (both types). At least they realized that having both players in a partnership declare is counterproductive, so they never did that.
</p>

<p>
I kept score. Inspired by the show (and the oversized deck), I opted to use an unusual notation. Here&rsquo;s what the score sheet looked like after we had played for a while.

<table class="score-table">

  <colgroup>
    <col class="spacer-col" />

<p>
At this point, the other players remarked that they didn&rsquo;t like the &ldquo;negative energy&rdquo; generated by the fact that a majority of the scores were negative. (Theatre people can be so superstitious.) To resolve the issue, I proposed a change to the scoring system: whenever a team was supposed to lose points from a failed declaration, we would simply add that number of points to the other team&rsquo;s score instead. This made the majority of scores positive, and so we were able to continue playing. Or we would have been able to, if we hadn&rsquo;t had to get back to work on the show. But it certainly was an interesting game until then.
