Maybe you can clue replacing that letter in one step, rather than chopping off one letter and then gluing on a new one.  It took me a while to realize you were using the word straight-up for its letters; I thought it was a clue for MAW or something.<br />

            Just below that: The audio is easy (visions of a beagle with a guitar...), but the video is really hard to locate.<br />
            Just left of BINGO: Google Image Search identified these as being Magic cards, but I don&rsquo;t know anything about that.<br />

I don&rsquo;t know if I would have gotten it without your comment #6; knowing that I was looking for some pattern among the squares, but not in rows or columns, really cut down on the noise.  Although I guess there is something that all the words have in common that helps, and it&rsquo;s pretty clear that their meanings aren&rsquo;t relevant, given how diverse they are.  I like it!

            Finally figured out the thing under the cryptarithm.  B. thought it was &ldquo;BAG + ASS&rdquo;, but even if that made any sense, you can&rsquo;t subtract the third bit.<br /><br />
            Greg identified the Klingon guy in the fourth column.  He couldn&rsquo;t remember which movie it was, but Google to the rescue: &ldquo;star trek&rdquo; &ldquo;eye patch&rdquo; and there he is.<br /><br />
            Uh, my mom ate the contents of package C.  I think we had it identified clearly though.<br /><br />
            Finally, testsolving quote of the day: C. pops in and asks what we&rsquo;re stuck on.  We point him to our spreadsheet.  He says, &ldquo;DK, mage, priest, rogue, lock, warrior... oh, it&rsquo;s cluing a race!  Oops, gotta go!&rdquo;  And we *still* don&rsquo;t know what the answer is.  Race to where?!<br /><br />

            We have almost all of the clues (still looking for a Pokemon expert, and have not yet resorted to Google Image Search for the ridged alien guy in the middle row), and are trying to extract.  The letter square is obviously a hint.  C. wants to do some kind of jumping thing, where you start on BINGO (hence N), then take the first letter of BINGO to jump to the cryptic clue at B, from there to the comic panel, etc.  But this doesn&rsquo;t seem to trace out or spell anything.<br /><br />

            The new version stopped us from using the letter square, so now we&rsquo;re focusing on the words themselves.  C. wants to look at the contents of each row and column; I started looking for something they could have in common, but they&rsquo;re pretty random, so we think it&rsquo;s the letters that matter.<br /><br />

            1.5 hours<br /><br />
            <strong>Describe what you tried.</strong><br /><br />
            Trying to make heads or tails of this bag of keyboard keys.  123456ABCDFGHNSVXZ doesn&rsquo;t look like anything to me...<br /><br />
            Meanwhile, Z. logs in and sees we&rsquo;re stuck on the Odd Man Out puzzle.  He looks at our &ldquo;odd men out&rdquo;.  He tilts his head and looks at us funny.  &ldquo;Armillary Sphere, Countersquall, Knight of the Reliquary, Volcanic Fallout.  Makes sense to me.&rdquo;  Zero prompting or anything.  I&rsquo;m glad we have such a variety of talent on this team!<br /><br />
            (To be fair, we were looking for another &ldquo;odd man out&rdquo;, not just &ldquo;these together clue the same word&rdquo;.)<br /><br />
            <strong>What did you like/dislike about this puzzle? How hard do you think it is? Is there anything you think should be changed?</strong><br /><br />
            Just reaching the point where getting more clues is boring, and running out of clues.  So it seems about right.<br /><br /></td>

            Got the rest of the clues, then N. stared at it for a while and figured it out.<br /><br />

            Seems to work fine!  N. says the flavortext was really helpful.<br /><br /></td>
