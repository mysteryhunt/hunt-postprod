<p>This puzzle presents as a big GIF.  The palette of the GIF
file, interpreted as ASCII, reads &ldquo;Pixels are UTF-8&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Interpreting the pixels as UTF-8 reveals Chinese numbers between 0 and
255 (either normal or financial, but this does not yet matter),
separated by spaces.</p>

<p>Treating each number as a byte gives a large animated GIF, where
each frame is a Hebrew letter (either red or blue), or the Hebrew word
&#x5d0;&#x5e4;&#x5e1;, or a blank.  The Hebrew word means zero; the letters are
interpreted as gematria (which doesn&rsquo;t have a zero, hence the need for
a special case).  The numbers, again, are between 0 and 255 </p>

<p>Treating the numbers as bytes again gives another image, which
reads &ldquo;odd red and even blue numbers are ones.&rdquo;  Interpreting the
Hebrew according to this instruction, you get &ldquo;even financial and odd
normal numbers = 1.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reinterpreting the Chinese gives another GIF, with the
answer, <b>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</b>:<br />
