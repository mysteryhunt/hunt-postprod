<p>Each puzzle answer can be matched with three different words in the various letters: a synonym, a rhyme, and a word that matches length and first/last letters. As a check, each contains two synonyms, two rhyming words, and two letter matches, and no answer is used twice in the same letter. These three match types are clued in the flavortext (&#8220;common sense&#8221; for synonym, &#8220;reason&#8221; as opposed to rhyme, and &#8220;wild word&#8221; displaying the length-and-letter matching scheme).</p>

<p>Counting the positions of the matching words in, e.g., the third letter, they occur at the 9th, 16th, 25th, 36th, 64th, and 81st words.  This is almost a contiguous subsequence of a well-known numerical sequence (the perfect squares): it is missing 49.  Thus you extract the 49th word of this letter, which is OUT.  Each letter uses a different sequence:</p>
<ul>
<li>Triangular numbers (1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...)</li>
<li>Fibonacci sequence</li>
<li>Squares</li>
<li>Powers of 2</li>
<li>Primes</li>
</ul>
<p>The extra words, in presented order, form the answer, <b>THROW GRAMMAR OUT THE WINDOW</b>.</p>
