<p>We&rsquo;re running a <a href="brackets.html">bracket contest</a> as a
fun diversion.</p>

<p>Sorry we got started on Friday at noon instead of earlier in the week. All
of the First Four games and half of the Second Round games have
already been played and the results provided for you.</p>

<p>Each team that submits a bracket correctly predicting the winners
of all games from the Second Round through the Regional Finals will be
eligible to enter the final part of this bracket contest (details to
come when you submit a correct bracket). Each team may only submit
one bracket per 20 minute half. Good luck!</p>
